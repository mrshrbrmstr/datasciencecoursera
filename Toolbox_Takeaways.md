This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **Help** toolbar button for more details on using R Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```

## Snippets from Students
-------------------------

* Read the error message. The answer is often right there.
* When you clone a repo to your local git environment it helps to use the -p argument so the prefix is set to https://
* If you don't remember to use the -p argument the origin can be changed (what I did) using the git remote set-url command.
